# How to add X
## Board
To add a another board you must edit the `Cargo.toml` and the `config/board.toml`
In the `Cargo.toml`, you must add the new board as an feature. The feature must match the 
board configuration in the `config/board`.

If you discover more common preprocessor configuration you can add them within `[all]`.

## Functionality
Modify the `whitelist_[function|var|type]` in the `build.rs` and optionally add a new header 
for which bindings should be generated.
It will likely be the case, that after adding a new header, that some board modification must 
be extended with more preprocessor configuration within the `config/board.toml`.
